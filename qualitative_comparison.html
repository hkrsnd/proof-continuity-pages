        Liam had finished his work early for the day, which meant that he would typically have ordered pizza for dinner. However, on this particular day, he decided against ordering pizza and opted for something else.
    </div>
    <div class="question">Does this imply that Liam didn't finish his work early?</div>
    <div class="ground-truth">Ground Truth: Yes (by Modus Tollens: A&rarr;B, &not;B &vdash; &not;A)</div>

            </div>
            <div class="trace-content">Okay, so I need to figure out if the conclusion that "Liam didn't finish his work early" logically follows from the given premises.

First, I'll break down the information. The first part says that finishing work early leads to ordering pizza. That sounds like a conditional statement: If he finished early, then he orders pizza. In FOL:
finishesEarly(Liam) &rarr; ordersPizza(Liam).

The second part is that he didn't order pizza:
&not;ordersPizza(Liam) &and; choosesElse(Liam).

Looking at the rules, I remember that Modus Tollens is the rule that applies here. Modus Tollens says that if we have A &rarr; B and we know that &not;B, then we can con<span class="truncated">[TRUNCATED &mdash; token limit reached]</span></div>

            </div>
            <div class="trace-content">Alright, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I need to identify the premises. The first premise states that if Liam finished his work early, he would typically order pizza:
EarlyFinish &rarr; OrdersPizza.

The second premise tells us that Liam decided against ordering pizza:
&not;OrdersPizza.

Now, I can use the contrapositive of the first statement:
&not;OrdersPizza &rarr; &not;EarlyFinish.

Applying the contrapositive, since we know &not;OrdersPizza is true, we can conclude that &not;EarlyFinish is true.

Therefore, the conclusion is that Liam didn't finish his work early.

Answer: Yes.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="observation">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The base model <em>identifies</em> Modus Tollens correctly but produces meandering prose that gets <strong>cut off</strong> before reaching a conclusion.
        The SAT model produces concise, directed reasoning: premises &rarr; rule (contrapositive) &rarr; application &rarr; conclusion. <strong>No wandering, no truncation.</strong>
        Answer-only training produces nearly identical output to base &mdash; the consistency signal is what drives structural improvement.

        If Jim cleans his room, he will receive a reward. And if he receives a reward, he will use it to buy a new toy. Jim decided to tidy up his room, hoping to earn a reward.

The first is cleaning_room(jim) &rarr; reward(jim).

I need to see if &not;cleaning_room(jim) leads to &not;buys_new_toy(jim).

            <div class="trace-content">The premises are that if Jim cleans his room, he'll get a reward, and if he gets a reward, he'll buy a new toy.

First, I translate the premises:
cleanRoom(jim) &rarr; reward(jim)
reward(jim) &rarr; buyToy(jim)

Using Hypothetical Syllogism to combine the two premises:
cleanRoom(jim) &rarr; buyToy(jim)

However, this doesn't help with the negation of cleanRoom(jim).

Since there's no valid inference from the premises that connects &not;cleanRoom(jim) to &not;buyToy(jim), I conclude that the premises don't support the conclusion.

Answer: No.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="observation">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> The SAT model doesn't just follow rules &mdash; it reasons about <strong>when rules don't apply</strong>.
        It chains the implications via Hypothetical Syllogism, then correctly identifies that the negated antecedent cannot yield a conclusion.
        This is <strong>metacognitive reasoning about inference validity</strong>, which prevents the "denying the antecedent" fallacy.
        The Diff-Anneal model, by contrast, applies Modus Ponens in the <em>wrong direction</em> (assuming Jim cleaned when the question says he didn't).

    <div class="observation">
        <strong>Key insight:</strong> Both models perform the same correct derivation (Mary IS taking a break).
        But the base model answers "Yes" to "Is Mary NOT taking a break?" &mdash; <strong>directly contradicting its own derivation</strong>.
        The SAT model adds <strong>Step 4</strong> to explicitly reconcile the derived conclusion with the question's negation.
        The extra step prevents the base model's contradiction error.

<!-- Summary Findings -->
<div class="card">
    <h2>Summary of Qualitative Findings</h2>

    <div class="finding finding-positive">
        <strong>1. SAT training prevents truncation.</strong>
        The base and answer-only DeepSeek models produce meandering prose that gets cut off at the token limit.
        SAT models produce concise, goal-directed reasoning that terminates with an answer.
    </div>

    <div class="finding finding-positive">
        <strong>2. SAT teaches metacognitive reasoning.</strong>
        SAT-trained models reason about <em>when rules don't apply</em> (Example 2: "there's no valid inference... so the premises don't support the conclusion").
        This higher-order reasoning prevents logical fallacies like denying the antecedent.
    </div>

    <div class="finding finding-positive">
        <strong>3. SAT enables self-correction.</strong>
        In Examples 4 and 5, SAT models initially produce wrong steps, then add corrective steps that reach the right answer.
        This pattern &mdash; wrong derivation followed by correct override &mdash; is unique to consistency-trained models.
    </div>

    <div class="finding finding-insight">
        <strong>4. Answer-only training doesn't change reasoning structure.</strong>
        For DeepSeek, answer-only completions are nearly identical to base &mdash; same rambling prose, same truncation.
        The model may learn to guess answers slightly better but doesn't develop structured reasoning.
    </div>

    <div class="finding finding-caution">
        <strong>5. Diff-Anneal produces structured format but less reliable reasoning.</strong>
        Diff models output well-formatted Step N: (Text)...(Logic)... sequences,
        but sometimes apply rules incorrectly (e.g., Modus Ponens in the wrong direction).
    </div>

    <div class="finding finding-positive">
        <strong>6. The consistency reward's main effect is on proof <em>organization</em>.</strong>
        Models learn to structure premises &rarr; derivation &rarr; conclusion, name inference rules explicitly,
        and reconcile derived conclusions with the question being asked.
