Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_54_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0972","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If mary is tired, does this mean that she will sleep?","context":"If someone is tired, then they will sleep.","completion":"<think>\nI need to formalize the given statements and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens, which is an inference rule.

The conclusion asked is \"he doesn't have pain in the head\", i.e., ~hasPainInHead(john). That is the negation of what we derived. There is no premise that would allow us to derive the negation.

If mary is ill, does this mean that she will take medicine?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and a conditional premise \"If mary is ill\". But the question is: does this entail that she will take medicine? That is, given the rule and the fact that Mary is ill, can we conclude she takes medicine? But the premise \"If mary is ill\" is not a fact that Mary is ill; it's a conditional. However, the typical modus ponens scenario: we have a conditional (if p then q) and the antecedent p, then we can derive q. Here we have the general conditional: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine.\" That is: \u2200x (ill(x) \u2192 takeMedicine(x)). And we have \"If mary is ill\" \u2013 that is, we are given that Mary is ill? Actually the phrasing \"If mary is ill\" might be ambiguous. In logical reasoning problems, often they present a conditional premise and then ask: if the antecedent holds, does the consequent follow?

Then we are asked: if we assume \"john has a cold\", does that entail \"he doesn't have to take rest\"? Actually, the question is phrased: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" That means we are considering the hypothetical: given the rule and the fact that John has a cold, can we derive that he doesn't have to take rest? But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't. The conclusion \"he doesn't have to take rest\" is the negation of what modus ponens would give. So it does not follow.\n\nBut let's be precise: The premises are the rule and the fact that John has a cold? The question says: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" It might be interpreted as: we have the rule (premise 1) and we are given that John has a cold (premise 2). Then we ask: does it follow that he doesn't have to take rest? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens.

However, the problem statement is: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" So we have two sentences: the first is a premise, the second is a conditional question. Actually, the second part \"If paul is tired\" might be an additional premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" Typically, such problems give two premises: the general rule and a specific fact. Here, the specific fact is \"paul is tired\" is given? The phrasing \"If paul is tired\" could be part of the question, not a premise. But in logical entailment, we consider the premises and ask if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then the conclusion would be \"Paul will take a nap.\" But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That would be the negation of the expected conclusion.

The problem statement: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap.

In logical reasoning, we treat \"If paul is tired\" as the antecedent of the question. Actually, the question is: \"If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That means: assuming Paul is tired, can we conclude he won't take a nap? So the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then we ask: does it follow that Paul won't take a nap? Clearly not, because from (1) and (2) we derive that Paul will take a nap, which contradicts \"he won't take a nap.\" So the entailment does not hold.\n\nThus, I'll treat \"Paul is tired\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Paul is tired.

Or equivalently: Given the premise, does infection(john) imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? That is: Is it true that from the premise and infection(john) we can derive ~weakenedImmune(john)? Let's see.\n\nAssume infection(john). Then from Step 1, instantiate X = john: weakenedImmune(john) :- infection(john). Since infection(john) holds, by modus ponens we get weakenedImmune(john).

The phrasing \"If julie has been studying for many hours\" seems like a condition, not an asserted fact. The question is: does that condition imply that she isn't feeling very tired? So we need to check: from the rule and the assumption that Julie has been studying for many hours, can we derive that she isn't feeling very tired? Obviously not, because the rule says if she studies many hours then she is tired, so from the assumption we would derive she is tired, not that she isn't tired. So the conclusion \"she isn't feeling very tired\" does not follow.\n\nLet's formalize.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has been studying for many hours, then they are feeling very tired.

So if we have P, we get Q, not \u00acQ.\n\nThus the answer should be No, the implication that he won't take rest does not follow.\n\nNow, I need to write formal steps.\n\nStep 1: Formalize the universal rule.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is unwell, then they will take rest.

Actually, the question is: \"If john is unwell, does this imply that he won't take rest?\" In logical terms, we are asked: does (unwell(john) \u2192 \u00actakesRest(john)) follow from the premise? Or more simply, given the premise and the additional assumption unwell(john), can we derive \u00actakesRest(john)? The premises are the rule and the assumption that John is unwell. So we should treat \"john is unwell\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John is unwell.

Then we have: \"If john always has a positive attitude, does this mean that he will always have a better outlook on life?\" Wait, the phrasing is a bit ambiguous: \"If john always has a positive attitude\" could be a premise, but the question says: \"If john always has a positive attitude, does this mean that he will always have a better outlook on life?\" That seems like we are given that John always has a positive attitude as a premise, and we need to see if the conclusion follows. Let's parse carefully.\n\nThe theory is modus_ponens. The context: \"If someone always has a positive attitude, then they will always have a better outlook on life. If john always has a positive attitude, does this mean that he will always have a better outlook on life?\" So we have two parts: a general conditional statement, and a specific conditional statement about John. Actually, the second part is not a conditional; it's a premise: \"If john always has a positive attitude\" is given as a condition? The phrasing \"If john always has a positive attitude, does this mean that he will always have a better outlook on life?\" could be interpreted as: Given that John always has a positive attitude, does it follow that he will always have a better outlook on life? That is exactly modus ponens.\n\nSo we have:\nPremise 1: For all X, if X has a positive attitude, then X has a better outlook.\nPremise 2: John has a positive attitude.\nConclusion: John has a better outlook.\n\nWe need to check if the conclusion follows from the premises via modus ponens.\n\nLet me formalize.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone always has a positive attitude, then they will always have a better outlook on life.

Actually reading: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" The context says: \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer duration. If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and a conditional \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 that's a hypothesis. So we are asked: given the rule, does the hypothesis that John is exhausted imply that he won't sleep longer? That is, from the rule and the assumption that John is exhausted, can we derive that John will not sleep longer? Obviously not, because the rule says if exhausted then sleeps longer. So from exhausted(john) we would derive sleepsLonger(john), not its negation.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" That is: does (exhausted(john) \u2192 \u00acsleepsLonger(john)) follow from the premise? Or equivalently, given the premise and the additional assumption that John is exhausted, can we conclude that he won't sleep longer? That would be a contradiction with the premise.\n\nLet's formalize the assumption as a premise for the conditional. Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted , then they will sleep for a longer duration . If john is exhausted , does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" It seems we are to consider: Premise 1: exhausted(X) \u2192 sleepsLonger(X). Premise 2: exhausted(john).

If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\"\n\nSo we have a premise: \"If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\" And then a hypothetical: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is, we are asked: Given the premise, does \"John has an infection\" entail \"John does not have a weakened immune system\"? That would be a contradiction because the premise says if he has an infection, then he has a weakened immune system. So from \"John has an infection\" we would derive \"John has a weakened immune system\", not \"John does not have a weakened immune system\". Therefore the implication does not hold.\n\nBut we need to formalize.\n\nLet's define predicates:\ninfection(X): X has an infection.\nweakenedImmune(X): X has a weakened immune system.\n\nPremise: If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\nLogic: weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).\n\nNow the question: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is: Given the premise, does infection(john) entail ~weakenedImmune(john)? Or more precisely: Does the premise together with infection(john) logically imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? Clearly not, because from infection(john) and the rule, we get weakenedImmune(john). That contradicts ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication is false.\n\nBut we must check if there's any trick: The theory is modus_ponens, which is a valid inference rule. But the question is whether a particular implication holds. The answer is No.\n\nLet's write steps.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system. This is a universal conditional premise.</text>\n<logic>weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow we consider the hypothetical: \"If john has an infection\" \u2013 that is an additional assumption. So we treat it as a temporary premise for the sake of the implication? Actually the question is: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" In logical terms: Does (weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X)) entail (infection(john) -> ~weakenedImmune(john))? Or equivalently: Given the premise, does infection(john) imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? That is: Is it true that from the premise and infection(john) we can derive ~weakenedImmune(john)? Let's see.\n\nAssume infection(john). Then from Step 1, instantiate X = john: weakenedImmune(john) :- infection(john). Since infection(john) holds, by modus ponens we get weakenedImmune(john). So we derive weakenedImmune(john), not its negation. Therefore we cannot derive ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication does not hold.\n\nI'll formalize the derivation assuming infection(john) and show we get weakenedImmune(john).\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume for the sake of the implication that John has an infection.

That contradicts the claim that we would derive ~weakenedImmune(john). Therefore the implication \"if John has an infection, then he doesn't have a weakened immune system\" is not entailed by the premise.

But the rule says if she hasn't eaten, she will feel weak. So from \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the rule, we derive that she will feel weak, not that she won't feel weak. The conclusion \"she won't feel weak\" is the opposite.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" That is: from the premise \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the general rule, can we conclude \"she won't feel weak\"? Obviously not, because the rule implies she will feel weak. So the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to show the formal steps. I'll treat \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" as a premise for the query?

The context says: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If john is feeling tired, ...\". That means we are given that John is feeling tired? Or is it a hypothetical? In logical entailment questions, typically we are given the premises and asked if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest. But the question is phrased as \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, does the conditional statement \"If John is feeling tired, then he needs to get some rest\" follow? But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question? Wait, the phrasing \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually, the typical format: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" I think the intended premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest.

Therefore, the entailment does not hold.\n\nBut to be precise, we need to treat \"If john is exhausted\" as an additional premise for the entailment check? Actually the question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That is: given the general rule, and given that John is exhausted (as a hypothetical), does it logically follow that John won't take a nap?

The statement \"If jill is exhausted\" is part of the question, but it's not asserted as true. The question is: \"If jill is exhausted, does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" That means we are to assume \"jill is exhausted\" as a hypothetical and see if \"she won't take a nap\" follows from the theory plus that assumption.\n\nBut careful: The theory is modus_ponens, and the premises are only the conditional rule. The question is: \"If jill is exhausted, does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" In logical terms: Given the rule \"If exhausted then nap\", and assuming \"jill is exhausted\", can we derive \"not (jill takes nap)\"? That would be a contradiction because from the rule and the assumption we would derive \"jill takes nap\".

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. However, in logical reasoning problems like this, the typical setup is: we have a conditional rule, and we are asked: given the antecedent (John is exhausted), does the conclusion (he doesn't need to rest) follow? But the rule says if exhausted then needs rest. So from \"John is exhausted\" we would derive \"John needs rest\", not \"John doesn't need rest\".

Actually, the phrase \"If john is exhausted\" is likely a hypothetical: if we assume John is exhausted, then does it follow that he doesn't need to rest? But from the rule, if John is exhausted, then he needs rest. So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet me formalize: we have the rule, and we have the fact that John is exhausted? The problem says \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 it might be a conditional question. In logical entailment, we check: from the premises, does the conclusion follow? The premises are: (1) If someone is exhausted, they need rest. (2) John is exhausted.

The premises are: (1) If someone forgot to turn off the lights, then they will have to pay a fine. (2) Juan forgot to turn off the lights. Then the conclusion would be: He will have to pay a fine.

That would be a contradiction because from the conditional and the assumption, we would derive that he will have to pay a fine, not that he won't.

Let's parse: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The word \"this\" likely refers to the combination of the theory and the assumption that Juan forgot. So we have two premises: the conditional and the fact that Juan forgot. Then we ask: does that entail that he won't have to pay a fine?

Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe the second premise is not given as a fact but as a conditional assumption? In logical entailment, we consider the premises as given. The text says: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" This could be interpreted as: Given the conditional premise, does the statement \"Juan forgot to turn off the lights\" entail \"he won't have to pay a fine\"? That is, we have premise: payFine(X) :- forgotToTurnOffLights(X). And we have premise: forgotToTurnOffLights(juan). Does that entail ~payFine(juan)?

The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\"\n\nI think the second sentence is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That is the question. So we have two premises: \n1. If someone has little money, then they cannot afford luxury items.\n2. Jane has little money. (Because \"If jane has little money\" is likely a premise given for the question? Actually, the typical modus ponens setup: We have a conditional and a fact. The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That suggests we are to assume Jane has little money as a premise? Let's check: The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jane has little money, does it imply that she can afford luxury items? So we have two premises: the general rule and the fact that Jane has little money. Then we ask: does that imply she can afford luxury items? The answer should be No, because the rule says she cannot afford luxury items.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer provided is \"No.\" That matches: from \"has little money\" we derive \"cannot afford luxury items\", not \"can afford luxury items\".

Actually reading: \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. Let's look at the full context:\n\nTheory: modus_ponens\nIf someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late. If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\n\nIt seems the second sentence is the hypothesis: \"If jared has a lot of work\" is given as an additional premise? Or is it part of the question? Typically in such problems, we have a premise \"Jared has a lot of work\" and then we ask about the conclusion. But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't. So the entailment to \"he won't stay up late\" is false.\n\nThus, we need to see if from the premises we can derive that Jared won't stay up late. The premises are:\n\n1. \u2200X (hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X))\n2. hasLotOfWork(jared)   (this is given as part of the condition? Actually the phrase \"If jared has a lot of work\" might be a premise. In logical entailment questions, often we have a set of premises and a conclusion. Here the conclusion is \"he won't stay up late\". So we need to check if ~stayUpLate(jared) follows from the premises.\n\nBut do we have hasLotOfWork(jared) as a premise? The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens.

But the rule says if she hasn't eaten, she will feel weak. So from \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the rule, we derive that she will feel weak, not that she won't feel weak. The conclusion \"she won't feel weak\" is the opposite.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" That is: from the premise \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the general rule, can we conclude \"she won't feel weak\"? Obviously not, because the rule implies she will feel weak. So the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to show the formal steps. I'll treat \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" as a premise for the query? Actually, the problem statement gives only one premise: the general rule.

The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

If Jill is unwell, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have the general rule, and we are asked: given that Jill is unwell, does it imply that she won't take medicine? That is, from \"Jill is unwell\" and the rule, can we derive \"Jill will not take medicine\"? That would be a contradiction because the rule says if unwell then take medicine.\n\nBut the correct answer is given as \"No\".

The phrasing \"If Jill is unwell\" suggests we are to assume that premise for the sake of the implication? Actually, the question is: \"If Jill is unwell, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" In logical terms, we are asked: Does the statement \"Jill is unwell\" entail \"Jill will not take medicine\" given the theory? That is, from the rule and the assumption that Jill is unwell, can we derive that she won't take medicine? No, we derive the opposite.\n\nBut wait: maybe the question is ambiguous. Let's read exactly: \"If someone is unwell, then they will take medicine. If Jill is unwell, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" The \"this\" likely refers to the whole preceding statement. So we have the rule, and we are asked: if Jill is unwell, does it follow that she won't take medicine? That is, does \"Jill is unwell\" together with the rule imply \"Jill will not take medicine\"? To check entailment, we assume the premises (the rule and that Jill is unwell) and see if the conclusion (she won't take medicine) must be true.\n\nSo we need to add the premise that Jill is unwell.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume Jill is unwell.

The context says: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If john is feeling tired, ...\". That means we are given that John is feeling tired? Or is it a hypothetical? In logical entailment questions, typically we are given the premises and asked if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest. But the question is phrased as \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, does the conditional statement \"If John is feeling tired, then he needs to get some rest\" follow? But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question? Wait, the phrasing \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually, the typical format: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" I think the intended premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest.

The theory only gives the conditional rule. The question seems to ask: given the rule and the assumption that John is excited, does it entail that he won't go for a movie? But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that.

So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited?

Actually the question says: \"If john has a headache , does this mean that he won't take medicine?\" The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. It seems we are given that John has a headache as a premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone has a headache, then they will take medicine. If john has a headache , does this mean that he won't take medicine?\" The typical modus ponens scenario: we have a conditional and the antecedent, so we can derive the consequent. But here the conclusion is \"he won't take medicine\", which is the negation of the consequent. So we need to check if from the conditional and the antecedent we can derive the negation of the consequent. That would be invalid.\n\nBut wait: maybe the question is asking: given the conditional, and given that John has a headache, does it follow that he won't take medicine? That would be a contradiction because from the conditional and the antecedent we derive that he will take medicine, not that he won't. So the answer should be No.\n\nBut let's be precise: we need to treat \"If john has a headache\" as a premise? Actually the sentence \"If john has a headache , does this mean that he won't take medicine?\" could be interpreted as: Suppose we know that John has a headache. Does it follow that he won't take medicine? But we already have the conditional that if he has a headache he will take medicine. So from the conditional and the fact that he has a headache, we derive that he will take medicine. That contradicts \"he won't take medicine\". So the conclusion \"he won't take medicine\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows.\n\nThus, we need to include the fact that John has a headache as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John has a headache.

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest.

Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_135_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0986","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If jenny has a cold, does this imply that she will sneeze often?","context":"If someone has a cold, then they will sneeze often.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the given premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens, which is a rule of inference: if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q is true.\n\nThe statement: \"If someone has a cold, then they will sneeze often.\" This is a universal conditional statement.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has a cold, then they will sneeze often.

That would be a contradiction because the premise says if he has an infection, then he has a weakened immune system. So from \"John has an infection\" we would derive \"John has a weakened immune system\", not \"John does not have a weakened immune system\".

Actually the question is: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" In logical terms: Does (weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X)) entail (infection(john) -> ~weakenedImmune(john))? Or equivalently: Given the premise, does infection(john) imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? That is: Is it true that from the premise and infection(john) we can derive ~weakenedImmune(john)? Let's see.\n\nAssume infection(john). Then from Step 1, instantiate X = john: weakenedImmune(john) :- infection(john). Since infection(john) holds, by modus ponens we get weakenedImmune(john).

Actually, the question says: \"If john was running late, does this mean that he had to rush?\" That phrasing could be interpreted as: we are given that John was running late, and we ask whether it follows that he had to rush. But let's read carefully: \"If john was running late, does this mean that he had to rush?\" This is ambiguous: it could be asking whether the conditional \"if John was running late then he had to rush\" follows from the theory. However, the theory is modus_ponens, which is an inference rule. The typical modus ponens scenario: we have a conditional and the antecedent, and we derive the consequent. So likely the premises are:\n\n1. If someone was running late, then they had to rush. (Universal)\n2. John was running late.

The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\"\n\nSo we have a premise: \"If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\" And then a hypothetical: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is, we are asked: Given the premise, does \"John has an infection\" entail \"John does not have a weakened immune system\"? That would be a contradiction because the premise says if he has an infection, then he has a weakened immune system. So from \"John has an infection\" we would derive \"John has a weakened immune system\", not \"John does not have a weakened immune system\". Therefore the implication does not hold.\n\nBut we need to formalize.\n\nLet's define predicates:\ninfection(X): X has an infection.\nweakenedImmune(X): X has a weakened immune system.\n\nPremise: If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\nLogic: weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).\n\nNow the question: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is: Given the premise, does infection(john) entail ~weakenedImmune(john)? Or more precisely: Does the premise together with infection(john) logically imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? Clearly not, because from infection(john) and the rule, we get weakenedImmune(john). That contradicts ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication is false.\n\nBut we must check if there's any trick: The theory is modus_ponens, which is a valid inference rule. But the question is whether a particular implication holds. The answer is No.\n\nLet's write steps.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system. This is a universal conditional premise.</text>\n<logic>weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow we consider the hypothetical: \"If john has an infection\" \u2013 that is an additional assumption. So we treat it as a temporary premise for the sake of the implication? Actually the question is: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" In logical terms: Does (weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X)) entail (infection(john) -> ~weakenedImmune(john))? Or equivalently: Given the premise, does infection(john) imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? That is: Is it true that from the premise and infection(john) we can derive ~weakenedImmune(john)? Let's see.\n\nAssume infection(john). Then from Step 1, instantiate X = john: weakenedImmune(john) :- infection(john). Since infection(john) holds, by modus ponens we get weakenedImmune(john). So we derive weakenedImmune(john), not its negation. Therefore we cannot derive ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication does not hold.\n\nI'll formalize the derivation assuming infection(john) and show we get weakenedImmune(john).\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume for the sake of the implication that John has an infection.

Actually, the second premise is \"martha is tired\"? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they need to take rest. If martha is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to take rest?\" The context gives only one explicit premise: \"If someone is tired, then they need to take rest.\" Then it asks: \"If martha is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to take rest?\" So we have a hypothetical: we are to assume \"martha is tired\" as an additional premise for the implication? The phrasing \"If martha is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to take rest?\" suggests we are to consider: given the first premise and the assumption that Martha is tired, does it follow that she doesn't need to take rest? That would be a contradiction because from the first premise and \"martha is tired\", we would derive that she needs rest, not that she doesn't need rest. So the conclusion \"she doesn't need to take rest\" does not follow.\n\nBut to be precise, we need to treat \"martha is tired\" as a premise for the purpose of evaluating the implication. So we have two premises: the universal rule and the fact about Martha.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Martha is tired.

The context says: \"If someone is excited, then they will plan a trip.\" This is a universal statement.

Second, a conditional statement \"If debbie is excited\" is given as a premise? Actually, the phrasing \"If debbie is excited\" might be a premise given in the question. But in the typical modus ponens pattern, we have a conditional and the antecedent, then we derive the consequent. Here, the conditional is the universal rule. The second part \"If debbie is excited\" could be interpreted as \"Debbie is excited\" is given. However, it says \"If debbie is excited, does this entail that she will plan a trip?\" That could be read as: Given the rule and given that Debbie is excited, does it entail she will plan a trip? But the \"If debbie is excited\" is part of the question, not a separate premise. Actually, looking at the structure: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is excited, then they will plan a trip. If debbie is excited, does this entail that she will plan a trip?\" I think the intended reading is: We have a universal rule: If someone is excited, they plan a trip.

Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone has not eaten their lunch, then they will feel weak.

But the rule says if she hasn't eaten, she will feel weak. So from \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the rule, we derive that she will feel weak, not that she won't feel weak. The conclusion \"she won't feel weak\" is the opposite.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" That is: from the premise \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the general rule, can we conclude \"she won't feel weak\"? Obviously not, because the rule implies she will feel weak. So the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to show the formal steps. I'll treat \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" as a premise for the query?

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired.

That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_35_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0924","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If jill is tired, does this imply that she won't sleep early?","context":"If someone is tired, then they will sleep early.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.

Let's look at the full context:\n\nTheory: modus_ponens\nIf someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late. If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\n\nIt seems the second sentence is the hypothesis: \"If jared has a lot of work\" is given as an additional premise? Or is it part of the question? Typically in such problems, we have a premise \"Jared has a lot of work\" and then we ask about the conclusion. But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't.

The premises are:\n\n1. \u2200X (hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X))\n2. hasLotOfWork(jared)   (this is given as part of the condition? Actually the phrase \"If jared has a lot of work\" might be a premise. In logical entailment questions, often we have a set of premises and a conclusion.

The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens.

But the premise \"John is exhausted\" is actually given? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. However, in logical reasoning problems like this, the typical setup is: we have a conditional rule, and we are asked: given the antecedent (John is exhausted), does the conclusion (he doesn't need to rest) follow? But the rule says if exhausted then needs rest. So from \"John is exhausted\" we would derive \"John needs rest\", not \"John doesn't need rest\". The question is whether it entails that he doesn't need rest. That would be the opposite.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" It seems we are to assume John is exhausted as a premise? Actually, the phrase \"If john is exhausted\" is likely a hypothetical: if we assume John is exhausted, then does it follow that he doesn't need to rest? But from the rule, if John is exhausted, then he needs rest. So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet me formalize: we have the rule, and we have the fact that John is exhausted? The problem says \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 it might be a conditional question. In logical entailment, we check: from the premises, does the conclusion follow? The premises are: (1) If someone is exhausted, they need rest. (2) John is exhausted. The conclusion proposed: John does not need rest. Does that follow? No, because from (1) and (2) we derive John needs rest, which contradicts the conclusion. So the conclusion does not follow.\n\nBut is \"John is exhausted\" given as a premise? The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" could be interpreted as \"Suppose John is exhausted\". In typical logic puzzles, the context gives the premises, and the question asks about entailment. Here the theory is modus_ponens, and the example is: If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest? So we have two premises: the rule and the fact that John is exhausted.

That is, from \"Jill is unwell\" and the rule, can we derive \"Jill will not take medicine\"? That would be a contradiction because the rule says if unwell then take medicine.\n\nBut the correct answer is given as \"No\".

If Jill is unwell, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" The \"this\" likely refers to the whole preceding statement. So we have the rule, and we are asked: if Jill is unwell, does it follow that she won't take medicine? That is, does \"Jill is unwell\" together with the rule imply \"Jill will not take medicine\"?

The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense.

Here the context is: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this mean that she will take medicine?\" So there are two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional statement \"If sarah is ill\". That conditional might be an additional premise, or it might be part of the question. In logical terms, we have:\n\nPremise 1: If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. (Universal)\nPremise 2: Sarah is ill. (Fact)\nQuestion: Does it follow that Sarah will take medicine?\n\nBut the text says \"If sarah is ill\" \u2013 it could be that we are given that Sarah is ill as a fact. However, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be ambiguous. In typical modus ponens examples, we have a conditional and the antecedent, then we derive the consequent. So I'll assume that \"If sarah is ill\" is actually stating that Sarah is ill (i.e., the antecedent is true). Alternatively, it could be that we are asked: if we assume Sarah is ill, then can we conclude she will take medicine? That is essentially the same: given the rule and the assumption that Sarah is ill, we can derive that she will take medicine. So the answer should be Yes.\n\nLet me formalize.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is ill, then they will take medicine.

The theory only gives the conditional rule. The question seems to ask: given the rule and the assumption that John is excited, does it entail that he won't go for a movie? But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that. So we need to check if from the rule and the assumption that John is excited, we can derive that he won't go for a movie. That would be a contradiction.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is excited , then they will go for a movie . If john is excited , does this entail that he won't go for a movie?\" It seems like we have two parts: the theory (modus_ponens) and a specific conditional statement. Then a question: If John is excited, does this entail that he won't go for a movie? So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited? The question says \"If john is excited\", which might be part of the hypothesis. So we treat \"John is excited\" as an additional premise for the entailment check.

But given the theory modus_ponens, and the typical structure, I think the intended meaning is: We have the rule \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine.\" And we are given \"Alice is ill.\" Then we ask: Does this imply that she will take medicine?

However, the problem statement is: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" So we have two sentences: the first is a premise, the second is a conditional question. Actually, the second part \"If paul is tired\" might be an additional premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" Typically, such problems give two premises: the general rule and a specific fact. Here, the specific fact is \"paul is tired\" is given? The phrasing \"If paul is tired\" could be part of the question, not a premise. But in logical entailment, we consider the premises and ask if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then the conclusion would be \"Paul will take a nap.\" But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That would be the negation of the expected conclusion. So we need to check if from the premises we can derive that Paul won't take a nap.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is given as \"No.\" That suggests that from the premises we cannot derive that Paul won't take a nap. Indeed, from the premises we can derive that Paul will take a nap, so the opposite does not follow.\n\nLet me formalize the second premise explicitly: \"Paul is tired.\" That is given? The problem statement: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" The phrase \"If paul is tired\" might be a premise, but it's phrased as a conditional. In logical reasoning, we treat \"If paul is tired\" as the antecedent of the question. Actually, the question is: \"If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That means: assuming Paul is tired, can we conclude he won't take a nap? So the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then we ask: does it follow that Paul won't take a nap? Clearly not, because from (1) and (2) we derive that Paul will take a nap, which contradicts \"he won't take a nap.\" So the entailment does not hold.\n\nThus, I'll treat \"Paul is tired\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Paul is tired.

From steps 1-3, we have derived takesNap(paul). There is no premise that would allow deriving ~takesNap(paul). In fact, takesNap(paul) and ~takesNap(paul) are contradictory.

The theory only gives the conditional rule. The question seems to ask: given the rule and the assumption that John is excited, does it entail that he won't go for a movie? But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that. So we need to check if from the rule and the assumption that John is excited, we can derive that he won't go for a movie. That would be a contradiction.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is excited , then they will go for a movie . If john is excited , does this entail that he won't go for a movie?\" It seems like we have two parts: the theory (modus_ponens) and a specific conditional statement. Then a question: If John is excited, does this entail that he won't go for a movie? So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited? The question says \"If john is excited\", which might be part of the hypothesis. So we treat \"John is excited\" as an additional premise for the entailment check.

Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone has not eaten their lunch, then they will feel weak.

But the rule says if she hasn't eaten, she will feel weak. So from \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the rule, we derive that she will feel weak, not that she won't feel weak. The conclusion \"she won't feel weak\" is the opposite.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" That is: from the premise \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the general rule, can we conclude \"she won't feel weak\"? Obviously not, because the rule implies she will feel weak. So the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to show the formal steps. I'll treat \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" as a premise for the query? Actually, the problem statement gives only one premise: the general rule. The second part is the conditional question: \"If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" That is: assume \"notEatenLunch(alice)\" and ask whether \"~feelsWeak(alice)\" follows.

The question is: \"If jill is exhausted, does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" In logical terms: Given the rule \"If exhausted then nap\", and assuming \"jill is exhausted\", can we derive \"not (jill takes nap)\"? That would be a contradiction because from the rule and the assumption we would derive \"jill takes nap\". So \"she won't take a nap\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows.\n\nBut let's formalize step by step. We need to treat \"jill is exhausted\" as an additional premise for the sake of the entailment check. So we have:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume Jill is exhausted (for the sake of the entailment question).</text>\n<logic>exhausted(jill).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from steps 1 and 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Jill is exhausted and if someone is exhausted they take a nap, Jill takes a nap.</text>\n<logic>takesNap(jill).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion we are asked about is \"she won't take a nap\", i.e., ~takesNap(jill). From steps 1 and 2, we derived takesNap(jill). So ~takesNap(jill) is not entailed; it is inconsistent with the premises. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nNote: The question says \"does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" The \"this\" refers to the theory plus the condition \"If jill is exhausted\". So we have the rule and the assumption that Jill is exhausted. From that, we cannot derive that she won't take a nap; we derive that she will take a nap. So entailment does not hold.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":53,"completion_chars":2508},{"id":"modus_ponens_133_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0350","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If john is exhausted , does this entail that he will take a nap?","context":"If someone is exhausted, then they will take a nap.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the given premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens, which is a rule of inference: if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q is true.\n\nThe premises are:\n1. \"If someone is exhausted, then they will take a nap.\" This is a universal statement.\n2. \"John is exhausted.\"\n\nThe question: Does this entail that he will take a nap?\n\nLet me formalize.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is exhausted, then they will take a nap.

However, the problem statement is: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" So we have two sentences: the first is a premise, the second is a conditional question. Actually, the second part \"If paul is tired\" might be an additional premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" Typically, such problems give two premises: the general rule and a specific fact. Here, the specific fact is \"paul is tired\" is given? The phrasing \"If paul is tired\" could be part of the question, not a premise. But in logical entailment, we consider the premises and ask if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then the conclusion would be \"Paul will take a nap.\" But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That would be the negation of the expected conclusion. So we need to check if from the premises we can derive that Paul won't take a nap.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is given as \"No.\" That suggests that from the premises we cannot derive that Paul won't take a nap. Indeed, from the premises we can derive that Paul will take a nap, so the opposite does not follow.\n\nLet me formalize the second premise explicitly: \"Paul is tired.\" That is given? The problem statement: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" The phrase \"If paul is tired\" might be a premise, but it's phrased as a conditional. In logical reasoning, we treat \"If paul is tired\" as the antecedent of the question. Actually, the question is: \"If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That means: assuming Paul is tired, can we conclude he won't take a nap? So the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then we ask: does it follow that Paul won't take a nap? Clearly not, because from (1) and (2) we derive that Paul will take a nap, which contradicts \"he won't take a nap.\" So the entailment does not hold.\n\nThus, I'll treat \"Paul is tired\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Paul is tired.

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" So we have a universal conditional premise, and we are given that John is exhausted? Actually, the statement \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. The question is: given the theory (modus_ponens) and the premise \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer period of time\", and we consider the hypothetical: if John is exhausted, does that entail that he won't sleep for a longer period of time? The correct answer is No, because modus ponens would actually entail that he will sleep longer, not that he won't.\n\nBut we need to formalize. Let's treat the premise as given, and the question as asking: from the premise alone, can we derive that if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer? Or perhaps the question is: Suppose we also assume John is exhausted. Does that imply he won't sleep longer?

That would be: does (exhausted(john) -> sleepsLonger(john)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))?

That's what I'll assume.\n\nSo I'll add the assumption as a premise for the sake of the question? Actually, the question says \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" It's asking whether the conditional statement \"if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer\" follows from the given premise. That is: does (for all X: exhausted(X) -> sleepsLonger(X)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))?

Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_118_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0708","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If sara is exhausted, does this entail that she feels sleepy?","context":"If someone is exhausted, then they feel sleepy.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the given premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens.

The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

The question is: \"If jill is exhausted, does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" In logical terms: Given the rule \"If exhausted then nap\", and assuming \"jill is exhausted\", can we derive \"not (jill takes nap)\"? That would be a contradiction because from the rule and the assumption we would derive \"jill takes nap\". So \"she won't take a nap\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows.\n\nBut let's formalize step by step. We need to treat \"jill is exhausted\" as an additional premise for the sake of the entailment check. So we have:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume Jill is exhausted (for the sake of the entailment question).</text>\n<logic>exhausted(jill).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from steps 1 and 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Jill is exhausted and if someone is exhausted they take a nap, Jill takes a nap.</text>\n<logic>takesNap(jill).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion we are asked about is \"she won't take a nap\", i.e., ~takesNap(jill). From steps 1 and 2, we derived takesNap(jill). So ~takesNap(jill) is not entailed; it is inconsistent with the premises. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nNote: The question says \"does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" The \"this\" refers to the theory plus the condition \"If jill is exhausted\". So we have the rule and the assumption that Jill is exhausted. From that, we cannot derive that she won't take a nap; we derive that she will take a nap.

The context says: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If john is feeling tired, ...\". That means we are given that John is feeling tired? Or is it a hypothetical? In logical entailment questions, typically we are given the premises and asked if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest. But the question is phrased as \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, does the conditional statement \"If John is feeling tired, then he needs to get some rest\" follow? But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question? Wait, the phrasing \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually, the typical format: \"Theory: modus_ponens.

The theory only gives the conditional rule. The question seems to ask: given the rule and the assumption that John is excited, does it entail that he won't go for a movie? But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that. So we need to check if from the rule and the assumption that John is excited, we can derive that he won't go for a movie. That would be a contradiction.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is excited , then they will go for a movie . If john is excited , does this entail that he won't go for a movie?\" It seems like we have two parts: the theory (modus_ponens) and a specific conditional statement. Then a question: If John is excited, does this entail that he won't go for a movie? So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited? The question says \"If john is excited\", which might be part of the hypothesis. So we treat \"John is excited\" as an additional premise for the entailment check.

This is a universal conditional statement.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(X) :- ill(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe second premise is \"If sarah is ill\". That is a conditional assumption, not a fact. The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill.

From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

Wait, the statement is \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" The context seems to be: we are given the theory modus_ponens, and we have the conditional rule. Then we are asked: if we assume \"john has a cold\", does that entail \"he doesn't have to take rest\"? Actually, the question is phrased: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" That means we are considering the hypothetical: given the rule and the fact that John has a cold, can we derive that he doesn't have to take rest? But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't. The conclusion \"he doesn't have to take rest\" is the negation of what modus ponens would give. So it does not follow.\n\nBut let's be precise: The premises are the rule and the fact that John has a cold? The question says: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" It might be interpreted as: we have the rule (premise 1) and we are given that John has a cold (premise 2). Then we ask: does it follow that he doesn't have to take rest? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens.

The theory is modus_ponens, but the question asks: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\"\n\nFirst, formalize the given premise.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. This is a universal conditional statement.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(X) :- ill(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe second premise is \"If sarah is ill\". That is a conditional assumption, not a fact. The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill. This is given as a premise.</text>\n<logic>ill(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1 and step 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Sarah is ill and if someone is ill they take medicine, Sarah takes medicine.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(sarah). From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B. So still No.\n\nThus, regardless of interpretation, the answer is No.\n\nI'll proceed with the interpretation that Sarah is ill as a fact.\n\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":48,"completion_chars":4007},{"id":"modus_ponens_124_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0227","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?","context":"If someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the premises and the question.

Let's look at the full context:\n\nTheory: modus_ponens\nIf someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late. If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\n\nIt seems the second sentence is the hypothesis: \"If jared has a lot of work\" is given as an additional premise? Or is it part of the question? Typically in such problems, we have a premise \"Jared has a lot of work\" and then we ask about the conclusion. But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't. So the entailment to \"he won't stay up late\" is false.\n\nThus, we need to see if from the premises we can derive that Jared won't stay up late. The premises are:\n\n1. \u2200X (hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X))\n2. hasLotOfWork(jared)   (this is given as part of the condition? Actually the phrase \"If jared has a lot of work\" might be a premise. In logical entailment questions, often we have a set of premises and a conclusion. Here the conclusion is \"he won't stay up late\". So we need to check if ~stayUpLate(jared) follows from the premises.\n\nBut do we have hasLotOfWork(jared) as a premise? The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens. That contradicts ~stayUpLate(jared) unless the system is inconsistent. But we cannot derive ~stayUpLate(jared) from these premises.

The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest. But the question is phrased as \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, does the conditional statement \"If John is feeling tired, then he needs to get some rest\" follow? But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question?

If john is excited , does this entail that he won't go for a movie?\" It seems like we have two parts: the theory (modus_ponens) and a specific conditional statement. Then a question: If John is excited, does this entail that he won't go for a movie? So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited? The question says \"If john is excited\", which might be part of the hypothesis. So we treat \"John is excited\" as an additional premise for the entailment check. So we have:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John is excited.

From steps 1 and 2 we derived goForMovie(john). So ~goForMovie(john) does not follow; in fact it contradicts the derived conclusion.

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_98_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_1143","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If sara is ill, does this entail that she won't have a sore throat?","context":"If someone is ill, then they will have a sore throat.","completion":"<think>\nFirst, I need to formalize the premises.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is ill, then they will have a sore throat.

So we need to treat \"Jenna has a cold\" as an additional premise for the purpose of the implication.

Actually reading: \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. Let's look at the full context:\n\nTheory: modus_ponens\nIf someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late. If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\n\nIt seems the second sentence is the hypothesis: \"If jared has a lot of work\" is given as an additional premise? Or is it part of the question? Typically in such problems, we have a premise \"Jared has a lot of work\" and then we ask about the conclusion. But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't. So the entailment to \"he won't stay up late\" is false.\n\nThus, we need to see if from the premises we can derive that Jared won't stay up late. The premises are:\n\n1. \u2200X (hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X))\n2. hasLotOfWork(jared)   (this is given as part of the condition? Actually the phrase \"If jared has a lot of work\" might be a premise. In logical entailment questions, often we have a set of premises and a conclusion. Here the conclusion is \"he won't stay up late\". So we need to check if ~stayUpLate(jared) follows from the premises.\n\nBut do we have hasLotOfWork(jared) as a premise? The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens.

Actually reading: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" The context says: \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer duration. If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and a conditional \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 that's a hypothesis. So we are asked: given the rule, does the hypothesis that John is exhausted imply that he won't sleep longer? That is, from the rule and the assumption that John is exhausted, can we derive that John will not sleep longer? Obviously not, because the rule says if exhausted then sleeps longer. So from exhausted(john) we would derive sleepsLonger(john), not its negation.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" That is: does (exhausted(john) \u2192 \u00acsleepsLonger(john)) follow from the premise? Or equivalently, given the premise and the additional assumption that John is exhausted, can we conclude that he won't sleep longer? That would be a contradiction with the premise.\n\nLet's formalize the assumption as a premise for the conditional. Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted , then they will sleep for a longer duration . If john is exhausted , does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" It seems we are to consider: Premise 1: exhausted(X) \u2192 sleepsLonger(X). Premise 2: exhausted(john).

If mike is exhausted , does this entail that he won't sleep for hours?\" It seems there are two sentences: the first is the rule, the second is a conditional \"If mike is exhausted\" which might be a premise. Actually, it's ambiguous: \"If mike is exhausted\" could be a premise, but the question is \"does this entail that he won't sleep for hours?\" So we have:\n\nPremise 1: If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for hours.\nPremise 2: Mike is exhausted.\nConclusion: Mike won't sleep for hours.\n\nWe need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nSo I'll treat \"Mike is exhausted\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Mike is exhausted.

Actually reading: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. It might be: We are given that Jane has little money? Let's parse the full text:\n\n\"Theory: modus_ponens\nIf someone has little money, then they cannot afford luxury items . If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\"\n\nI think the second sentence is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That is the question. So we have two premises: \n1. If someone has little money, then they cannot afford luxury items.\n2. Jane has little money. (Because \"If jane has little money\" is likely a premise given for the question? Actually, the typical modus ponens setup: We have a conditional and a fact. The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That suggests we are to assume Jane has little money as a premise? Let's check: The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jane has little money, does it imply that she can afford luxury items? So we have two premises: the general rule and the fact that Jane has little money. Then we ask: does that imply she can afford luxury items? The answer should be No, because the rule says she cannot afford luxury items.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer provided is \"No.\" That matches: from \"has little money\" we derive \"cannot afford luxury items\", not \"can afford luxury items\". So the implication to \"she can afford luxury items\" does not follow.\n\nLet's formalize:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Jane has little money.

The phrasing: \"If sarah is ill, does this mean that she will take medicine?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Sarah is ill, does it follow that she will take medicine? But the statement \"If sarah is ill\" might be a conditional premise. Actually, looking at the example format, the context gives premises, then the question asks about entailment. Here the context is: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this mean that she will take medicine?\" So there are two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional statement \"If sarah is ill\".

So I'll assume that \"If sarah is ill\" is actually stating that Sarah is ill (i.e., the antecedent is true). Alternatively, it could be that we are asked: if we assume Sarah is ill, then can we conclude she will take medicine?

If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\"\n\nSo we have a premise: \"If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\" And then a hypothetical: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is, we are asked: Given the premise, does \"John has an infection\" entail \"John does not have a weakened immune system\"? That would be a contradiction because the premise says if he has an infection, then he has a weakened immune system. So from \"John has an infection\" we would derive \"John has a weakened immune system\", not \"John does not have a weakened immune system\". Therefore the implication does not hold.\n\nBut we need to formalize.\n\nLet's define predicates:\ninfection(X): X has an infection.\nweakenedImmune(X): X has a weakened immune system.\n\nPremise: If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system.\nLogic: weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).\n\nNow the question: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" That is: Given the premise, does infection(john) entail ~weakenedImmune(john)? Or more precisely: Does the premise together with infection(john) logically imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? Clearly not, because from infection(john) and the rule, we get weakenedImmune(john). That contradicts ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication is false.\n\nBut we must check if there's any trick: The theory is modus_ponens, which is a valid inference rule. But the question is whether a particular implication holds. The answer is No.\n\nLet's write steps.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has an infection, then they have a weakened immune system. This is a universal conditional premise.</text>\n<logic>weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow we consider the hypothetical: \"If john has an infection\" \u2013 that is an additional assumption. So we treat it as a temporary premise for the sake of the implication? Actually the question is: \"If john has an infection, does this imply that he doesn't have a weakened immune system?\" In logical terms: Does (weakenedImmune(X) :- infection(X)) entail (infection(john) -> ~weakenedImmune(john))? Or equivalently: Given the premise, does infection(john) imply ~weakenedImmune(john)? That is: Is it true that from the premise and infection(john) we can derive ~weakenedImmune(john)? Let's see.\n\nAssume infection(john). Then from Step 1, instantiate X = john: weakenedImmune(john) :- infection(john). Since infection(john) holds, by modus ponens we get weakenedImmune(john). So we derive weakenedImmune(john), not its negation. Therefore we cannot derive ~weakenedImmune(john). So the implication does not hold.\n\nI'll formalize the derivation assuming infection(john) and show we get weakenedImmune(john).\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume for the sake of the implication that John has an infection.

However, the problem statement is: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" So we have two sentences: the first is a premise, the second is a conditional question. Actually, the second part \"If paul is tired\" might be an additional premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" Typically, such problems give two premises: the general rule and a specific fact. Here, the specific fact is \"paul is tired\" is given? The phrasing \"If paul is tired\" could be part of the question, not a premise. But in logical entailment, we consider the premises and ask if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then the conclusion would be \"Paul will take a nap.\" But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That would be the negation of the expected conclusion. So we need to check if from the premises we can derive that Paul won't take a nap.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is given as \"No.\" That suggests that from the premises we cannot derive that Paul won't take a nap.

The problem statement: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap.

So the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then we ask: does it follow that Paul won't take a nap? Clearly not, because from (1) and (2) we derive that Paul will take a nap, which contradicts \"he won't take a nap.\" So the entailment does not hold.\n\nThus, I'll treat \"Paul is tired\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Paul is tired.

This is a universal conditional statement.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(X) :- ill(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe second premise is \"If sarah is ill\". That is a conditional assumption, not a fact. The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill. This is given as a premise.</text>\n<logic>ill(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1 and step 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Sarah is ill and if someone is ill they take medicine, Sarah takes medicine.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(sarah). From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

Actually reading: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" The context says: \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer duration. If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and a conditional \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 that's a hypothesis. So we are asked: given the rule, does the hypothesis that John is exhausted imply that he won't sleep longer? That is, from the rule and the assumption that John is exhausted, can we derive that John will not sleep longer? Obviously not, because the rule says if exhausted then sleeps longer. So from exhausted(john) we would derive sleepsLonger(john), not its negation.\n\nBut let's be precise: The question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" That is: does (exhausted(john) \u2192 \u00acsleepsLonger(john)) follow from the premise? Or equivalently, given the premise and the additional assumption that John is exhausted, can we conclude that he won't sleep longer? That would be a contradiction with the premise.\n\nLet's formalize the assumption as a premise for the conditional. Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted , then they will sleep for a longer duration . If john is exhausted , does this imply that he won't sleep for a longer duration?\" It seems we are to consider: Premise 1: exhausted(X) \u2192 sleepsLonger(X). Premise 2: exhausted(john).

But the premise \"John is exhausted\" is actually given? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. However, in logical reasoning problems like this, the typical setup is: we have a conditional rule, and we are asked: given the antecedent (John is exhausted), does the conclusion (he doesn't need to rest) follow? But the rule says if exhausted then needs rest. So from \"John is exhausted\" we would derive \"John needs rest\", not \"John doesn't need rest\". The question is whether it entails that he doesn't need rest. That would be the opposite.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" It seems we are to assume John is exhausted as a premise? Actually, the phrase \"If john is exhausted\" is likely a hypothetical: if we assume John is exhausted, then does it follow that he doesn't need to rest? But from the rule, if John is exhausted, then he needs rest. So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet me formalize: we have the rule, and we have the fact that John is exhausted? The problem says \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 it might be a conditional question. In logical entailment, we check: from the premises, does the conclusion follow? The premises are: (1) If someone is exhausted, they need rest. (2) John is exhausted. The conclusion proposed: John does not need rest. Does that follow? No, because from (1) and (2) we derive John needs rest, which contradicts the conclusion. So the conclusion does not follow.\n\nBut is \"John is exhausted\" given as a premise? The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" could be interpreted as \"Suppose John is exhausted\". In typical logic puzzles, the context gives the premises, and the question asks about entailment. Here the theory is modus_ponens, and the example is: If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest.

Let's see.\n\nIf we assume exhausted(john), then from Step 1 we can derive sleepsLonger(john). That is the opposite of ~sleepsLonger(john). So we cannot derive ~sleepsLonger(john); in fact, we derive the negation of that.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n\nI should show the derivation if we assume exhausted(john).

That would be: does (exhausted(john) -> sleepsLonger(john)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))? That is not valid.\n\nBut the phrasing \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" could be interpreted as: Given the premise, and given that John is exhausted, can we conclude he won't sleep longer? That's what I'll assume.\n\nSo I'll add the assumption as a premise for the sake of the question? Actually, the question says \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" It's asking whether the conditional statement \"if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer\" follows from the given premise. That is: does (for all X: exhausted(X) -> sleepsLonger(X)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))?

The question is: \"If jill is exhausted, does this entail that she won't take a nap?\" That means we are to assume \"jill is exhausted\" as a hypothetical and see if \"she won't take a nap\" follows from the theory plus that assumption.\n\nBut careful: The theory is modus_ponens, and the premises are only the conditional rule.

Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone has not eaten their lunch, then they will feel weak. If alice has not eaten her lunch, does this mean that she won't feel weak?\" So we have the general rule, and then we are asked: given that Alice has not eaten her lunch, does it follow that she won't feel weak? But the rule says if she hasn't eaten, she will feel weak. So from \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" and the rule, we derive that she will feel weak, not that she won't feel weak.

Obviously not, because the rule implies she will feel weak. So the answer is No.\n\nBut I need to show the formal steps. I'll treat \"Alice has not eaten her lunch\" as a premise for the query?

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. However, in logical reasoning problems like this, the typical setup is: we have a conditional rule, and we are asked: given the antecedent (John is exhausted), does the conclusion (he doesn't need to rest) follow? But the rule says if exhausted then needs rest. So from \"John is exhausted\" we would derive \"John needs rest\", not \"John doesn't need rest\". The question is whether it entails that he doesn't need rest. That would be the opposite.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" It seems we are to assume John is exhausted as a premise? Actually, the phrase \"If john is exhausted\" is likely a hypothetical: if we assume John is exhausted, then does it follow that he doesn't need to rest? But from the rule, if John is exhausted, then he needs rest. So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet me formalize: we have the rule, and we have the fact that John is exhausted? The problem says \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 it might be a conditional question. In logical entailment, we check: from the premises, does the conclusion follow? The premises are: (1) If someone is exhausted, they need rest. (2) John is exhausted. The conclusion proposed: John does not need rest. Does that follow? No, because from (1) and (2) we derive John needs rest, which contradicts the conclusion. So the conclusion does not follow.\n\nBut is \"John is exhausted\" given as a premise? The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" could be interpreted as \"Suppose John is exhausted\". In typical logic puzzles, the context gives the premises, and the question asks about entailment. Here the theory is modus_ponens, and the example is: If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest? So we have two premises: the rule and the fact that John is exhausted.

Actually, the question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this entail that he will sleep for a longer period of time?\" The phrasing is ambiguous: it might be asking whether, given the general rule and the additional premise that John is exhausted, we can conclude he will sleep longer.

But the premise \"If mary is ill\" is not a fact that Mary is ill; it's a conditional. However, the typical modus ponens scenario: we have a conditional (if p then q) and the antecedent p, then we can derive q. Here we have the general conditional: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine.\" That is: \u2200x (ill(x) \u2192 takeMedicine(x)). And we have \"If mary is ill\" \u2013 that is, we are given that Mary is ill? Actually the phrasing \"If mary is ill\" might be ambiguous. In logical reasoning problems, often they present a conditional premise and then ask: if the antecedent holds, does the consequent follow? So I think the intended interpretation is: we have the general rule, and we are also given that Mary is ill. Then we ask: does it follow that Mary will take medicine? That is classic modus ponens.

If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a hypothetical: \"If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" That means we are considering the scenario where we assume \"john is tired\" as an additional premise, and then ask whether that implies \"he doesn't need to rest.\" But the conclusion we are testing is a negation: \"he doesn't need to rest.\" So we need to see if from \"tired(john)\" and the rule, we can derive \"~needsRest(john).\"\n\nBut the rule says if tired then needs rest. So from tired(john) we would derive needsRest(john), not its negation. So the implication \"if john is tired, then he doesn't need to rest\" is false given the rule. But the question is: \"does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" That is, does the premise \"john is tired\" imply the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\"? Given the rule, it implies the opposite. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet's formalize: We have the general rule as step 1. We are considering the additional premise: \"john is tired.\" That is given in the question as the antecedent of the implication we are testing? Actually, the phrasing: \"If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" This is asking: does the statement \"john is tired\" entail the statement \"he doesn't need to rest\"? So we need to check whether from \"tired(john)\" we can derive \"~needsRest(john)\" using the given rule and logical inference.\n\nSo we add \"tired(john)\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John is tired.

The conclusion we are asked about is \"he doesn't need to rest,\" i.e., ~needsRest(john). That is the negation of what we derived. There is no premise that would allow us to derive ~needsRest(john). In fact, from the premises, we have derived the opposite. Therefore, the implication does not hold; we cannot validly infer ~needsRest(john) from the premises.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":2981},{"id":"modus_ponens_52_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0490","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If john has a headache, does this mean that he won't take painkillers?","context":"If someone has a headache, then they will take painkillers.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the premises and the conclusion.

If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If alice is ill\" is a hypothesis. The question is: does that hypothesis imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from the rule and the assumption that Alice is ill, can we derive that she won't take medicine? Or is the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" entailed?\n\nLet's parse: The theory is modus_ponens. The rule: ill \u2192 takesMedicine. The assumption: ill(alice). From modus ponens, we derive takesMedicine(alice). The conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(alice). That is the opposite of what modus ponens gives. So the premises (rule + assumption) do not entail ~takesMedicine(alice); they entail takesMedicine(alice). Therefore, the implication \"if alice is ill, then she won't take medicine\" is not implied by the given rule. In fact, the rule implies the opposite.\n\nBut wait: The question phrasing: \"If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" This could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given the additional premise \"alice is ill\", does it follow that \"she won't take medicine\"? That is a direct logical entailment question.

Wait, the statement is \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" The context seems to be: we are given the theory modus_ponens, and we have the conditional rule. Then we are asked: if we assume \"john has a cold\", does that entail \"he doesn't have to take rest\"? Actually, the question is phrased: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" That means we are considering the hypothetical: given the rule and the fact that John has a cold, can we derive that he doesn't have to take rest? But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't. The conclusion \"he doesn't have to take rest\" is the negation of what modus ponens would give. So it does not follow.\n\nBut let's be precise: The premises are the rule and the fact that John has a cold? The question says: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" It might be interpreted as: we have the rule (premise 1) and we are given that John has a cold (premise 2). Then we ask: does it follow that he doesn't have to take rest? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens. So we need to check if from the rule and the fact we can derive the negation.\n\nLet me formalize step by step.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John has a cold.

From takeRest(john) we cannot derive ~takeRest(john) unless the system is inconsistent. The premises are consistent (they don't contain a contradiction), so we cannot derive a contradiction.

But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't.

Or is it part of the question? Typically in modus ponens problems, we have two premises: a conditional and a fact that the antecedent is true. Here the second part is phrased as a conditional question, but likely it's meant to be: \"Jared has a lot of work. Does this mean that he will stay up late?\" However, the given text says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this mean that he will stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: We are given that \"If Jared has a lot of work\" is true? Actually, the correct answer is Yes, according to the prompt. So the intended premises are:\n\n1. If someone has a lot of work, then they will stay up late.\n2.

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. However, in logical reasoning problems like this, the typical setup is: we have a conditional rule, and we are asked: given the antecedent (John is exhausted), does the conclusion (he doesn't need to rest) follow? But the rule says if exhausted then needs rest. So from \"John is exhausted\" we would derive \"John needs rest\", not \"John doesn't need rest\". The question is whether it entails that he doesn't need rest. That would be the opposite.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest. If john is exhausted, does this mean that he doesn't need to rest?\" It seems we are to assume John is exhausted as a premise? Actually, the phrase \"If john is exhausted\" is likely a hypothetical: if we assume John is exhausted, then does it follow that he doesn't need to rest? But from the rule, if John is exhausted, then he needs rest. So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet me formalize: we have the rule, and we have the fact that John is exhausted? The problem says \"If john is exhausted\" \u2013 it might be a conditional question. In logical entailment, we check: from the premises, does the conclusion follow? The premises are: (1) If someone is exhausted, they need rest. (2) John is exhausted. The conclusion proposed: John does not need rest. Does that follow? No, because from (1) and (2) we derive John needs rest, which contradicts the conclusion. So the conclusion does not follow.\n\nBut is \"John is exhausted\" given as a premise? The phrasing \"If john is exhausted\" could be interpreted as \"Suppose John is exhausted\". In typical logic puzzles, the context gives the premises, and the question asks about entailment. Here the theory is modus_ponens, and the example is: If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest.

The theory only gives the conditional rule. The question seems to ask: given the rule and the assumption that John is excited, does it entail that he won't go for a movie? But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that. So we need to check if from the rule and the assumption that John is excited, we can derive that he won't go for a movie. That would be a contradiction.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is excited , then they will go for a movie .

Then a question: If John is excited, does this entail that he won't go for a movie? So we have the conditional rule as a premise, and we are asked: assuming John is excited, can we conclude that he won't go for a movie? That is, from \"excited(john)\" and \"goForMovie(X) :- excited(X)\", can we derive \"~goForMovie(john)\"? Clearly not, because from those we would derive \"goForMovie(john)\". So the answer is No.\n\nBut let's formalize carefully. We have the conditional rule as premise. We also have the assumption that John is excited?

This is given as a premise.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(X) :- tired(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nPremise 2: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Wait, careful: The second part is actually the question. The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_77_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_1425","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If josh is not feeling well, does this mean that he will take medicine?","context":"If they are not feeling well, then they will take medicine.","completion":"<think>\nI need to formalize the premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus ponens, which is a basic inference rule: from \"if P then Q\" and \"P\", we can derive \"Q\".\n\nThe given statement: \"If they are not feeling well, then they will take medicine.\" This is a universal statement about people.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is not feeling well, then they will take medicine.

However, the problem statement is: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" So we have two sentences: the first is a premise, the second is a conditional question. Actually, the second part \"If paul is tired\" might be an additional premise? Let's read carefully: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" Typically, such problems give two premises: the general rule and a specific fact. Here, the specific fact is \"paul is tired\" is given? The phrasing \"If paul is tired\" could be part of the question, not a premise. But in logical entailment, we consider the premises and ask if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then the conclusion would be \"Paul will take a nap.\" But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That would be the negation of the expected conclusion. So we need to check if from the premises we can derive that Paul won't take a nap.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer is given as \"No.\" That suggests that from the premises we cannot derive that Paul won't take a nap.

The problem statement: \"If someone is tired, then they will take a nap. If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" The phrase \"If paul is tired\" might be a premise, but it's phrased as a conditional. In logical reasoning, we treat \"If paul is tired\" as the antecedent of the question. Actually, the question is: \"If paul is tired, does this entail that he won't take a nap?\" That means: assuming Paul is tired, can we conclude he won't take a nap? So the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, they take a nap. (2) Paul is tired. Then we ask: does it follow that Paul won't take a nap? Clearly not, because from (1) and (2) we derive that Paul will take a nap, which contradicts \"he won't take a nap.\" So the entailment does not hold.\n\nThus, I'll treat \"Paul is tired\" as a premise.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Paul is tired.

But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't.

The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens.

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_147_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_1840","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If john has a headache, does this imply that he doesn't feel dizzy?","context":"If someone has a headache, then they feel dizzy.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the premises and the question.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens, but the question is about whether a particular implication holds.\n\nThe premises:\n1. \"If someone has a headache, then they feel dizzy.\" This is a universal conditional.\n2. \"John has a headache.\" This is a fact.\n\nThe question: \"Does this imply that he doesn't feel dizzy?\" That is, from the premises, can we derive that John does not feel dizzy?\n\nLet me formalize.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone has a headache, then they feel dizzy.

But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that.

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_18_qa_2__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_1895","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"no","question":"If john always has a positive attitude, does this imply that he won't always have a better outlook on life?","context":"If someone always has a positive attitude, then they will always have a better outlook on life.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the premises and the question.\n\nFirst, the theory is \"modus_ponens\", which suggests we are dealing with a conditional statement and a fact.\n\nThe given statement: \"If someone always has a positive attitude, then they will always have a better outlook on life.\" This is a universal conditional.\n\nThe question: \"If john always has a positive attitude, does this imply that he won't always have a better outlook on life?\" So we are given that John has a positive attitude, and we are asked whether it implies that he won't have a better outlook.

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" So we have a universal conditional premise, and we are given that John is exhausted? Actually, the statement \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. The question is: given the theory (modus_ponens) and the premise \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer period of time\", and we consider the hypothetical: if John is exhausted, does that entail that he won't sleep for a longer period of time? The correct answer is No, because modus ponens would actually entail that he will sleep longer, not that he won't.\n\nBut we need to formalize. Let's treat the premise as given, and the question as asking: from the premise alone, can we derive that if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer?

Let's see.\n\nIf we assume exhausted(john), then from Step 1 we can derive sleepsLonger(john). That is the opposite of ~sleepsLonger(john). So we cannot derive ~sleepsLonger(john); in fact, we derive the negation of that.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n\nI should show the derivation if we assume exhausted(john).

That is not valid.\n\nBut the phrasing \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" could be interpreted as: Given the premise, and given that John is exhausted, can we conclude he won't sleep longer? That's what I'll assume.\n\nSo I'll add the assumption as a premise for the sake of the question? Actually, the question says \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" It's asking whether the conditional statement \"if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer\" follows from the given premise. That is: does (for all X: exhausted(X) -> sleepsLonger(X)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))?

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_137_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_1648","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If john is angry , does this imply that he will shout?","context":"If someone is angry , then they will shout .","completion":"<think>\nI need to formalize the premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is angry, then they will shout.

Wait, the statement is: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The context gives: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights\" as a premise? Actually reading carefully: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. But looking at the structure: The theory is modus_ponens. The first sentence is the conditional. The second sentence is: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That seems like we are given that Juan forgot to turn off the lights? Actually it says \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights\" \u2013 that is a conditional antecedent. But in logical entailment questions, we typically have premises and a conclusion. The premises are: (1) If someone forgot to turn off the lights, then they will have to pay a fine. (2) Juan forgot to turn off the lights. Then the conclusion would be: He will have to pay a fine. But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That would be the opposite.\n\nWait, maybe the second part is not a premise but a hypothetical: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That is asking: Given the conditional premise, if we assume Juan forgot to turn off the lights, does it follow that he won't have to pay a fine? That would be a contradiction because from the conditional and the assumption, we would derive that he will have to pay a fine, not that he won't. So the answer should be No.\n\nBut to be precise, I'll treat the premises as: \n1. If someone forgot to turn off the lights, then they will have to pay a fine.\n2. Juan forgot to turn off the lights. (This is given as a condition? Actually the phrase \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Let's parse: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The word \"this\" likely refers to the combination of the theory and the assumption that Juan forgot. So we have two premises: the conditional and the fact that Juan forgot. Then we ask: does that entail that he won't have to pay a fine? That is asking whether ~payFine(juan) follows.\n\nSo I'll formalize:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Juan forgot to turn off the lights.

That is, does ~payFine(juan) follow? From step 3 we have payFine(juan). That is the opposite. So ~payFine(juan) does not follow; in fact, it is inconsistent with the premises. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe the second premise is not given as a fact but as a conditional assumption? In logical entailment, we consider the premises as given. The text says: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" This could be interpreted as: Given the conditional premise, does the statement \"Juan forgot to turn off the lights\" entail \"he won't have to pay a fine\"? That is, we have premise: payFine(X) :- forgotToTurnOffLights(X). And we have premise: forgotToTurnOffLights(juan). Does that entail ~payFine(juan)? Obviously not, because from those we derive payFine(juan).

Actually reading carefully: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. But looking at the structure: The theory is modus_ponens. The first sentence is the conditional. The second sentence is: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That seems like we are given that Juan forgot to turn off the lights? Actually it says \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights\" \u2013 that is a conditional antecedent. But in logical entailment questions, we typically have premises and a conclusion. The premises are: (1) If someone forgot to turn off the lights, then they will have to pay a fine. (2) Juan forgot to turn off the lights. Then the conclusion would be: He will have to pay a fine. But the question asks: \"does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That would be the opposite.\n\nWait, maybe the second part is not a premise but a hypothetical: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" That is asking: Given the conditional premise, if we assume Juan forgot to turn off the lights, does it follow that he won't have to pay a fine? That would be a contradiction because from the conditional and the assumption, we would derive that he will have to pay a fine, not that he won't. So the answer should be No.\n\nBut to be precise, I'll treat the premises as: \n1. If someone forgot to turn off the lights, then they will have to pay a fine.\n2. Juan forgot to turn off the lights. (This is given as a condition? Actually the phrase \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Let's parse: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" The word \"this\" likely refers to the combination of the theory and the assumption that Juan forgot. So we have two premises: the conditional and the fact that Juan forgot. Then we ask: does that entail that he won't have to pay a fine? That is asking whether ~payFine(juan) follows.\n\nSo I'll formalize:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Juan forgot to turn off the lights.

That is, does ~payFine(juan) follow? From step 3 we have payFine(juan). That is the opposite. So ~payFine(juan) does not follow; in fact, it is inconsistent with the premises. Therefore, the answer is No.\n\nBut wait, maybe the second premise is not given as a fact but as a conditional assumption? In logical entailment, we consider the premises as given. The text says: \"If juan forgot to turn off the lights, does this entail that he won't have to pay a fine?\" This could be interpreted as: Given the conditional premise, does the statement \"Juan forgot to turn off the lights\" entail \"he won't have to pay a fine\"? That is, we have premise: payFine(X) :- forgotToTurnOffLights(X). And we have premise: forgotToTurnOffLights(juan). Does that entail ~payFine(juan)?

This is a universal conditional statement.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(X) :- ill(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe second premise is \"If sarah is ill\". That is a conditional assumption, not a fact. The question is: does this imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from \"If Sarah is ill\" and the rule, can we derive \"she won't take medicine\"?\n\nActually, the phrasing \"If sarah is ill\" might be a premise itself. Let's read carefully: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two statements: the universal rule, and the conditional \"If sarah is ill\". The question is whether from these two we can conclude \"she won't take medicine\".\n\nBut \"If sarah is ill\" is not a fact that Sarah is ill; it's a hypothesis. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" and \"If P\" does not allow us to conclude anything about Q? Wait, \"If P\" alone is not a proposition; it's incomplete. In natural language, \"If sarah is ill\" might be intended as \"Sarah is ill\"? Possibly ambiguous. However, given the correct answer is \"No\", likely the interpretation is that we are given only the conditional \"If Sarah is ill\" as a premise, not the fact that she is ill. But \"If Sarah is ill\" by itself is not a complete premise; it's like saying \"Suppose Sarah is ill\". In logical reasoning, we cannot derive \"she won't take medicine\" from that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the premise is \"Sarah is ill\"? But then modus ponens would give \"she will take medicine\", so the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" would be false. So the answer would still be No because it does not imply she won't take medicine; it implies the opposite.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is ill, they take medicine. (2) Sarah is ill? Or \"If Sarah is ill\"? Let's parse: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If sarah is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Possibly the second part is a question: given the rule, and given that Sarah is ill (as a fact), does that imply she won't take medicine? That would be a clear No because the rule says she will take medicine. So the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" is the negation of what follows.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Sarah is ill as a premise, because otherwise we have no ground to derive anything about Sarah. The phrase \"If sarah is ill\" might be a misstatement meaning \"Sarah is ill\". Many logic puzzles phrase it that way.\n\nAssume:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Sarah is ill. This is given as a premise.</text>\n<logic>ill(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1 and step 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Sarah is ill and if someone is ill they take medicine, Sarah takes medicine.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(sarah).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(sarah). From the premises we derived takesMedicine(sarah), which contradicts ~takesMedicine(sarah). Therefore, the premises do not imply she won't take medicine; they imply she will take medicine. So the answer is No.\n\nIf instead the premise \"If sarah is ill\" is interpreted as a conditional statement (i.e., we are given \"If Sarah is ill, then ...\"? That doesn't make sense. Possibly it's \"Sarah is ill\" is a hypothesis, but we are asked if the implication holds: from the rule and the hypothesis, can we conclude she won't take medicine? That would be invalid because from \"If A then B\" and A, we get B, not ~B.

From modus ponens, we derive takesMedicine(alice). The conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(alice). That is the opposite of what modus ponens gives.

If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If john is feeling tired, ...\". That means we are given that John is feeling tired? Or is it a hypothetical? In logical entailment questions, typically we are given the premises and asked if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest.

But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question? Wait, the phrasing \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually, the typical format: \"Theory: modus_ponens.

Wait, the statement is \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" The context seems to be: we are given the theory modus_ponens, and we have the conditional rule. Then we are asked: if we assume \"john has a cold\", does that entail \"he doesn't have to take rest\"? Actually, the question is phrased: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" That means we are considering the hypothetical: given the rule and the fact that John has a cold, can we derive that he doesn't have to take rest? But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't. The conclusion \"he doesn't have to take rest\" is the negation of what modus ponens would give. So it does not follow.\n\nBut let's be precise: The premises are the rule and the fact that John has a cold? The question says: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" It might be interpreted as: we have the rule (premise 1) and we are given that John has a cold (premise 2). Then we ask: does it follow that he doesn't have to take rest? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens. So we need to check if from the rule and the fact we can derive the negation.\n\nLet me formalize step by step.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>John has a cold.

From takeRest(john) we cannot derive ~takeRest(john) unless the system is inconsistent. The premises are consistent (they don't contain a contradiction), so we cannot derive a contradiction.

If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" So we have a universal conditional premise, and we are given that John is exhausted? Actually, the statement \"If john is exhausted\" is part of the question, not necessarily a premise. The question is: given the theory (modus_ponens) and the premise \"If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer period of time\", and we consider the hypothetical: if John is exhausted, does that entail that he won't sleep for a longer period of time? The correct answer is No, because modus ponens would actually entail that he will sleep longer, not that he won't.\n\nBut we need to formalize. Let's treat the premise as given, and the question as asking: from the premise alone, can we derive that if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer? Or perhaps the question is: Suppose we also assume John is exhausted. Does that imply he won't sleep longer? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens.\n\nI'll formalize the premise.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is exhausted, then they will sleep for a longer period of time.

Let's see.\n\nIf we assume exhausted(john), then from Step 1 we can derive sleepsLonger(john). That is the opposite of ~sleepsLonger(john). So we cannot derive ~sleepsLonger(john); in fact, we derive the negation of that.\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n\nI should show the derivation if we assume exhausted(john). But the question might be: does the premise alone entail that if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer? That would be: does (exhausted(john) -> sleepsLonger(john)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))? That is not valid.\n\nBut the phrasing \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" could be interpreted as: Given the premise, and given that John is exhausted, can we conclude he won't sleep longer? That's what I'll assume.\n\nSo I'll add the assumption as a premise for the sake of the question? Actually, the question says \"If john is exhausted, does this mean that he won't sleep for a longer period of time?\" It's asking whether the conditional statement \"if John is exhausted then he won't sleep longer\" follows from the given premise. That is: does (for all X: exhausted(X) -> sleepsLonger(X)) imply (exhausted(john) -> ~sleepsLonger(john))? That is not logically valid.\n\nBut the correct answer is No, as per the example.\n\nI'll derive the correct conclusion from the premise and the assumption that John is exhausted, to show that we get the opposite.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume John is exhausted.

If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a hypothetical: \"If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" That means we are considering the scenario where we assume \"john is tired\" as an additional premise, and then ask whether that implies \"he doesn't need to rest.\" But the conclusion we are testing is a negation: \"he doesn't need to rest.\" So we need to see if from \"tired(john)\" and the rule, we can derive \"~needsRest(john).\"\n\nBut the rule says if tired then needs rest. So from tired(john) we would derive needsRest(john), not its negation. So the implication \"if john is tired, then he doesn't need to rest\" is false given the rule. But the question is: \"does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" That is, does the premise \"john is tired\" imply the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\"? Given the rule, it implies the opposite. So the answer should be No.\n\nLet's formalize: We have the general rule as step 1. We are considering the additional premise: \"john is tired.\" That is given in the question as the antecedent of the implication we are testing? Actually, the phrasing: \"If john is tired, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" This is asking: does the statement \"john is tired\" entail the statement \"he doesn't need to rest\"?

Looking at the context: \"If someone is ill, then they have a weakened immune system. If jill is ill, does this entail that she has a weakened immune system?\" It seems the second sentence is the question: given that Jill is ill (as a premise), does it entail that she has a weakened immune system?

Then we have a premise: \"If someone is exhausted, then they need to rest.\" Then we have a hypothetical: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" So we are asked: Given the premise, and assuming John is exhausted, can we conclude that he does not need to rest? That would be a contradiction because from the premise and the assumption we would derive that he needs rest. But the question is whether the premises imply that he doesn't need rest.

Actually, the question is: \"If john is exhausted, does this imply that he doesn't need to rest?\" That is: From the given premise alone, plus the additional assumption that John is exhausted, can we derive that John does not need rest?

So the conclusion \"he doesn't need to rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows.\n\nBut to be precise, we should treat \"john is exhausted\" as an additional premise for the sake of the implication.

So we are asked: given the rule, does the hypothesis that John is exhausted imply that he won't sleep longer? That is, from the rule and the assumption that John is exhausted, can we derive that John will not sleep longer? Obviously not, because the rule says if exhausted then sleeps longer.

In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent. The question might be: Does the rule \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest\" imply that \"If Cindy is tired, then she doesn't need to rest\"? That is asking whether the universal rule entails a specific conditional that contradicts it. That would also be No. But that's less likely.\n\nGiven the correct answer is No, and the theory is modus_ponens, I think the intended premises are as above.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"she doesn't need to rest\" does not follow.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":44,"completion_chars":5289},{"id":"modus_ponens_29_qa_0__eq_first_order_logic__modus_ponens_0057","logic_type":"first_order_logic","theory":"modus_ponens","theory_key":"first_order_logic/modus_ponens","expected_answer":"yes","question":"If john is ill, does this mean that he will take rest?","context":"If someone is ill, then they will take rest.","completion":"<think>\nI need to analyze the given premises and see if the conclusion follows.\n\nFirst, the theory is modus_ponens.

Actually, the question is phrased: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" That means we are considering the hypothetical: given the rule and the fact that John has a cold, can we derive that he doesn't have to take rest? But from the rule, if John has a cold, then he has to take rest. So we would derive that he has to take rest, not that he doesn't. The conclusion \"he doesn't have to take rest\" is the negation of what modus ponens would give. So it does not follow.\n\nBut let's be precise: The premises are the rule and the fact that John has a cold? The question says: \"If john has a cold, does this entail that he doesn't have to take rest?\" It might be interpreted as: we have the rule (premise 1) and we are given that John has a cold (premise 2). Then we ask: does it follow that he doesn't have to take rest? That would be a contradiction with modus ponens.

Let's read carefully:\n\n\"Theory: modus_ponens\nIf someone is unwell, then they will take rest. If john is unwell, does this imply that he won't take rest?\"\n\nInterpretation: We have a general rule: If someone is unwell, they will take rest. Then we have a hypothetical: \"If john is unwell\" \u2013 meaning we are considering the case where John is unwell. The question asks: does this imply that he won't take rest? So we are to determine whether from the rule and the assumption that John is unwell, we can conclude that John will not take rest.\n\nBut the rule says if unwell then take rest. So if John is unwell, he will take rest. That would mean he will take rest, not that he won't take rest. So the conclusion \"he won't take rest\" does not follow; in fact, the opposite follows.\n\nBut we must check if there's any trick. The theory is named modus_ponens, which is a valid inference rule: from P \u2192 Q and P, infer Q. Here P is \"John is unwell\", Q is \"John will take rest\". So if we have P, we get Q, not \u00acQ.\n\nThus the answer should be No, the implication that he won't take rest does not follow.\n\nNow, I need to write formal steps.\n\nStep 1: Formalize the universal rule.\n\n<step n=\"1\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>If someone is unwell, then they will take rest.

Actually, the question is: \"If john is unwell, does this imply that he won't take rest?\" In logical terms, we are asked: does (unwell(john) \u2192 \u00actakesRest(john)) follow from the premise? Or more simply, given the premise and the additional assumption unwell(john), can we derive \u00actakesRest(john)? The premises are the rule and the assumption that John is unwell.

The given facts are: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" So we have two premises: the universal rule, and the fact \"cindy is tired\"? Actually reading: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The phrasing \"If cindy is tired\" might be a premise or part of the question. In logical reasoning problems, often we have: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But the problem statement says: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the rule, and given the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\", does that imply she doesn't need to rest? But that's not a premise that Cindy is tired; it's a hypothetical. However, in typical modus ponens problems, we have a fact \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise. Let's check the correct answer given: \"The correct answer is: No.\" So if we had \"Cindy is tired\" as a premise, then from the rule we'd derive \"Cindy needs rest\", which would contradict \"she doesn't need to rest\". That would mean the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false, so answer No. But wait: The question is: \"does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" The \"this\" refers to the two statements: the rule and the conditional \"if Cindy is tired\". Actually, maybe the second part is not a premise but the question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is ambiguous.\n\nLet's parse: \"Theory: modus_ponens. If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly it's: Premise 1: If someone is tired, then they need to rest. Premise 2: Cindy is tired. Question: Does this imply that she doesn't need to rest? But then the correct answer would be No, because the premises imply she does need rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to \"she doesn't need to rest\" is false. So answer No.\n\nBut wait: The correct answer is given as No. So I'll assume the premises are: (1) If someone is tired, then they need to rest. (2) Cindy is tired. And the question is: Does this entail that she doesn't need to rest? That is a clear No.\n\nBut the problem statement only says \"If cindy is tired\" as part of the question, not as a separate premise. However, in the example format, they often present premises in the \"Context\" and then the question. Here the \"Theory\" is modus_ponens, and then two sentences: \"If someone is tired, then they need to rest. If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" Possibly the second sentence is the entire question: \"If cindy is tired, does this imply that she doesn't need to rest?\" That is asking: From the rule and the assumption that Cindy is tired, can we conclude she doesn't need rest? That would be No because the rule says if tired then need rest, so we'd conclude she needs rest, not that she doesn't. So the implication to the negation is not valid.\n\nI'll formalize with the fact that Cindy is tired as a premise, because otherwise we don't have a fact to apply modus ponens. But the problem might be testing whether we mistakenly think modus tollens or something. Let's proceed.\n\nSo I'll add:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Cindy is tired. This is given as a premise (from the statement \"If cindy is tired\" interpreted as a fact).</text>\n<logic>tired(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1, we can instantiate with X = cindy.\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Cindy is tired and if someone is tired they need rest, Cindy needs rest.</text>\n<logic>needsRest(cindy).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow the question is: Does the set of premises imply that she doesn't need rest? That would be ~needsRest(cindy). From step 3 we have needsRest(cindy). So we cannot derive ~needsRest(cindy). In fact, the premises are consistent with needsRest(cindy) and inconsistent with ~needsRest(cindy). So the answer is No.\n\nBut wait: Could there be a different interpretation? Perhaps the second part \"If cindy is tired\" is not a premise but a conditional antecedent.

But here it says \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" That could be interpreted as: Suppose we add the premise \"Jared has a lot of work\". Does that entail that he won't stay up late? But from the first premise, if Jared has a lot of work, then he will stay up late. So the conclusion would be that he will stay up late, not that he won't. So the entailment to \"he won't stay up late\" is false.\n\nThus, we need to see if from the premises we can derive that Jared won't stay up late. The premises are:\n\n1. \u2200X (hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X))\n2. hasLotOfWork(jared)   (this is given as part of the condition? Actually the phrase \"If jared has a lot of work\" might be a premise. In logical entailment questions, often we have a set of premises and a conclusion. Here the conclusion is \"he won't stay up late\". So we need to check if ~stayUpLate(jared) follows from the premises.\n\nBut do we have hasLotOfWork(jared) as a premise? The statement \"If jared has a lot of work, does this entail that he won't stay up late?\" could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jared has a lot of work, can we conclude that he won't stay up late? So we should treat \"Jared has a lot of work\" as an additional premise.\n\nThus premises:\n- Rule: hasLotOfWork(X) \u2192 stayUpLate(X)\n- Fact: hasLotOfWork(jared)\nConclusion: ~stayUpLate(jared)\n\nFrom the rule and fact, we can derive stayUpLate(jared) via modus ponens. That contradicts ~stayUpLate(jared) unless the system is inconsistent. But we cannot derive ~stayUpLate(jared) from these premises. So the entailment does not hold.\n\nLet's formalize.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Jared has a lot of work. This is given as a premise (from the conditional statement in the question).</text>\n<logic>hasLotOfWork(jared).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1 and step 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Jared has a lot of work and if someone has a lot of work they stay up late, Jared will stay up late.</text>\n<logic>stayUpLate(jared).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion we are asked about is \"he won't stay up late\", i.e., ~stayUpLate(jared). From steps 1-3, we have derived stayUpLate(jared). There is no premise that allows us to derive ~stayUpLate(jared). In fact, it is inconsistent with the derived fact.

If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\"\n\nI think the second sentence is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That is the question. So we have two premises: \n1. If someone has little money, then they cannot afford luxury items.\n2. Jane has little money. (Because \"If jane has little money\" is likely a premise given for the question? Actually, the typical modus ponens setup: We have a conditional and a fact. The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That suggests we are to assume Jane has little money as a premise? Let's check: The question is: \"If jane has little money, does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given that Jane has little money, does it imply that she can afford luxury items? So we have two premises: the general rule and the fact that Jane has little money. Then we ask: does that imply she can afford luxury items? The answer should be No, because the rule says she cannot afford luxury items.\n\nBut wait, the correct answer provided is \"No.\" That matches: from \"has little money\" we derive \"cannot afford luxury items\", not \"can afford luxury items\". So the implication to \"she can afford luxury items\" does not follow.\n\nLet's formalize:\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Jane has little money. This is given as a premise (since the question says \"If jane has little money\", we treat it as a conditional premise).</text>\n<logic>hasLittleMoney(jane).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow from step 1 and step 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Jane has little money and if someone has little money they cannot afford luxury items, Jane cannot afford luxury items.</text>\n<logic>~canAffordLuxury(jane).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe question asks: \"does this imply that she can afford luxury items?\" That would be canAffordLuxury(jane). From step 3 we have ~canAffordLuxury(jane). So the opposite is derived.

The context says: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If john is feeling tired, ...\". That means we are given that John is feeling tired? Or is it a hypothetical? In logical entailment questions, typically we are given the premises and asked if the conclusion follows. The premises are: (1) If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest. (2) John is feeling tired. Then the conclusion: John needs to get some rest. But the question is phrased as \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, does the conditional statement \"If John is feeling tired, then he needs to get some rest\" follow? But that's just an instance of the general rule, so it would be trivially true. However, the typical modus ponens problem gives the fact that John is tired as a premise. Let's check the example: In the reference example, they had \"Today, Jack finds himself utterly exhausted.\" That's a fact, not a conditional. So here, \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually reading: \"If someone is feeling tired, then they need to get some rest . If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" The period separates two sentences. The first is the rule. The second is: \"If john is feeling tired, does this entail that he needs to get some rest?\" That is asking: Given the rule, if we also assume John is feeling tired, does it follow that he needs rest? That is exactly modus ponens. So we have two premises: the rule, and the fact that John is feeling tired. But the fact is stated as a conditional in the question? Wait, the phrasing \"If john is feeling tired\" might be part of the question, not a premise. Actually, the typical format: \"Theory: modus_ponens.

But the rule says if excited then go for movie. So if John is excited, he will go for a movie. The conclusion \"he won't go for a movie\" is the negation of that.

This is a universally quantified premise.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(X) :- ill(X).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe second premise: \"If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Wait, careful: The question is: \"If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" Actually, the problem statement: \"If someone is ill, then they will take medicine. If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" So we have two parts: the general rule, and then a conditional: \"If alice is ill\" is a hypothesis. The question is: does that hypothesis imply that she won't take medicine? In other words, from the rule and the assumption that Alice is ill, can we derive that she won't take medicine? Or is the conclusion \"she won't take medicine\" entailed?\n\nLet's parse: The theory is modus_ponens. The rule: ill \u2192 takesMedicine. The assumption: ill(alice). From modus ponens, we derive takesMedicine(alice). The conclusion asked is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(alice). That is the opposite of what modus ponens gives. So the premises (rule + assumption) do not entail ~takesMedicine(alice); they entail takesMedicine(alice). Therefore, the implication \"if alice is ill, then she won't take medicine\" is not implied by the given rule. In fact, the rule implies the opposite.\n\nBut wait: The question phrasing: \"If alice is ill, does this imply that she won't take medicine?\" This could be interpreted as: Given the general rule, and given the additional premise \"alice is ill\", does it follow that \"she won't take medicine\"? That is a direct logical entailment question. The answer is No, because from ill(alice) and ill(X) \u2192 takesMedicine(X), we derive takesMedicine(alice), not its negation.\n\nLet's formalize the assumption \"alice is ill\" as a premise for the entailment.\n\n<step n=\"2\" type=\"premise\">\n<text>Assume Alice is ill. This is given as a premise for the implication.</text>\n<logic>ill(alice).</logic>\n</step>\n\nNow, from steps 1 and 2, we can derive:\n\n<step n=\"3\" type=\"derived\" from=\"1,2\">\n<text>Since Alice is ill and if someone is ill they take medicine, Alice takes medicine.</text>\n<logic>takesMedicine(alice).</logic>\n</step>\n\nThe conclusion we are asked about is \"she won't take medicine\", i.e., ~takesMedicine(alice). That is the negation of what we derived. There is no premise that supports ~takesMedicine(alice). Therefore, the premises do not entail ~takesMedicine(alice).\n\nThus, the answer is No.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No","num_steps":3,"context_chars":48,"completion_chars":2790}]}
